      You'll want day-old, chilled rice for fried rice. It's just the way it is.
      Sorry to the person who is craving fried rice and doesn't have any
      leftover rice in the fridge. The chilled rice crisps up in the skillet and
      doesn't get mushy like fresh rice would. We say no to mushy rice!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped green onions, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic, divided</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>3 cups day-old cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Stir together oyster sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a
      small bowl. Set aside.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet or wok over medium
      heat. Add shrimp, 1/4 cup green onions, and 1 tablespoon garlic. Cook,
      stirring constantly, until shrimp are firm and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.
      Transfer to a bowl.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Without cleaning the skillet, add another 1/2 tablespoon oil over medium
      heat. Add remaining 1/4 cup green onions, remaining 1 tablespoon garlic,
      and mixed vegetables. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables are tender,
      about 4 minutes. Push to the side of the skillet and add another 1
      tablespoon oil to the center. Add beaten egg and let sit for 20 seconds;
      then stir gently until large curds form, about 1 minute. Stir cooked eggs
      and vegetables together.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Increase heat to medium-high and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Stir in
      cooked rice and reserved sauce; flatten rice in skillet. Cook, flipping
      and turning occasionally, until rice is brown and crispy in some spots,
      about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cooked shrimp.
